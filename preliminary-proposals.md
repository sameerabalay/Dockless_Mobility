Proposal 1
Description

Shared transportation industry has boomed in recent years and growing rapidly because of the rise of traffic congestion, environmental impact and rise in share economy. City of Austin has been in the fore-front of green city initiative and have adapted these goals for their 2019 http://www.austintexas.gov/blog/10-sustainability-resolutions-2019 and one of them is drive less and reduce your carbon footprint. Rideshares, docked and dockless transportation have risen tremoudously in the past few years and have taken over the City of Austin. City of Austin as part of their Open Data initiative has been releasing multiple datasets for public use and one of them is Dockless scooter data. My goal is to use this dataset to do analysis and modeling.

Problem

Dockless scooters are everywhere in 5 mile radius of downtown Austin. My goal is to model mobility patterns of the scooters and predict from the model the number of scooters at different areas at a given time in the future. This model will hopefully help the City of Austin and the vendors operating the scooters handle the demands of the future rides.

Presentation

Primary mode of presentation will be through visualizations and slide presentations

Data Sources

https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Dockless-Vehicle-Trips/7d8e-dm7r . The data is available for download, direct connectivity and through API.

Next Steps

Download the data and do Exploratory Data Analysis. I have also contacted the data set owner to discuss potential ideas for analysis and modeling.

Proposal 2
Description Type 2 Diabetes is becoming a worldwide problem. Interventions like life style changes at the right time have proven to make a huge impact on the onset of Diabetes.

Problem

Run predictive modeling on diabetes data to determine important features that determine the onset of diabetes so appropriate intervention techniques can be used to prevent or push the onset of diabetes.

Presentation

Primary mode of presentation will be through Visualizations and slide presentations

Data Sources

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes and also use Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Next Steps

Download the data and do Exploratory Data Analysis. I'm also researching on other sources of data as there has been lot of analysis on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database

Proposal 3
Description Ever wondered listening to blog posts or websites rather than reading them. Personally I wish to hear the audio of the text written on a webpage rather than reading them especially when it is blog or news.

Problem Run deep learning alogrithms using Deep learning for Text to Speech to convert the blog posts into speech so they can be converted to audio.

Presentation

Primary mode of presentation will be through demo

Data Sources

Blogs on medium.com and Deep learning for Text to Speech (https://github.com/mozilla/TTS)

Next Steps

Research the Deep learning for Text to Speech package and run examples and start webscraping the blog posts for training.
